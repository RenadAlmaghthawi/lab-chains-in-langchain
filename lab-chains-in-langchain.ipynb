Start with defining the search interval as the entire array.\\n2. Calculate the middle index of the search interval.\\n3. Compare the target value with the value at the middle index.\\n4. If the target value is equal to the middle value, the search is successful and the index of the target value is returned.\\n5. If the target value is less than the middle value, repeat the search on the left half of the array (excluding the middle value).\\n6. If the target value is greater than the middle value, repeat the search on the right half of the array (excluding the middle value).\\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.\\n\\nThe key advantage of binary search is that it has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This makes it much more efficient than linear search algorithms, especially for large arrays.\\n\\nIn summary, binary search is a powerful algorithm that efficiently searches for a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Water splitting: Water molecules are split into oxygen, protons, and electrons by a process called photolysis. The oxygen is released as a byproduct, while the protons and electrons are used in the next steps of photosynthesis.\\n\\n3. Electron transport chain: The electrons from water are passed through a series of proteins in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast, creating a proton gradient across the membrane.\\n\\n4. ATP synthesis: The proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP, a molecule that stores energy for cellular processes.\\n\\n5. Carbon fixation: Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken up by the plant and converted into a 3-carbon molecule called 3-phosphoglycerate through a series of reactions known as the Calvin cycle.\\n\\n6. Sugar production: The 3-phosphoglycerate molecules are further converted into glucose and other sugars, which can be used by the plant for energy or stored for later use.\\n\\nOverall, photosynthesis is a crucial process for life on Earth, as it provides the energy source for most living organisms and is responsible for the oxygen we breathe.'"
